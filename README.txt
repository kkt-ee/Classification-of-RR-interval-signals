HYPOTHESIS: 

OBJECTIVE: Recurrance Quantification Analysis (RQA) of R-R intervals of "smokers data"

 
STEP 1: R-R interval extaction

STEP 2: RQA calculations for 11 features

STEP 3: Feature reduction (Important Predictors only)
 
STEP 4: Neural Network
                       MLP
                       RBF
